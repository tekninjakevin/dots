##info

 I maintain this repository as a e for my dotfiles (which are also used
 to rice my computer).


## Basic goals and principles of my rice:
    + More Screen Space: I want to keep Decorations to 'minimal'. I want to keep
	  the UI as distraction free as Possable by automating  as much as possible and
	  keep UI clutter to a minimum.
	+ Naturalness: -- I want the number of key presses I have to make to get what
	I want to be as little as possible.
	+ Economy: -- All the basic programs I use should be simple and light on system
	resources. Because of this, many are terminal or ncurses programs
	+ Keyboard/vim-centrality: -- All my terminal apps (and other programs) use vim
	keys when possible. My hands never need leave the home row or thereabout.
	+ Lots of color: -- Many rices stick to one general color palette. I like my
	system to be very vibrant. If you disagree, you can easily change it.
	+ Throw back to msdos -- Lots of Ascii and ansi and large text thanks to figlet

## Attention!!!
	All files and configs in this repository are a backup copy of the original
	files of my OS. They are not a model or a guide Exaples are that some links
	are hardcoded to my machine and not all my vim plug ins are listed. Althow
	you are welcomed to cut n past any thing you can find usefull. Be aware You
	take full responsibility for the consequences of using them in your OS.

## More about Ricing


================================================================================
## What The Heck are Dot files
 > Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-y systems for things like
 > my shell, ~/.zshrc, our editor in ~/.vimrc, and many others. They are called
 > "dotfiles" as they typically are named with a leading . Making them hidden
 > files on your system, although this is not a strict requirement.
 > Since these files are all plain text, we can gather them together in a git
 > repository and use that to track the changes you make over time.

## What is a rice.
 -- From [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/intro-to-dotfiles).

 > "Rice" is a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual improvements
 > and customizations on one's desktop. It was inherited from the practice of
 > customizing cheap Asian import cars to make them appear to be faster than they
 > actually were - which was also known as "ricing". Here on /r/unixporn, the
 > word is accepted by the majority of the community and is used sparingly to
 > refer to a visually attractive desktop upgraded beyond the default.
